so by keeping a reference instead of making nested schema or embedded schema we keep our code cleaner as published games for each publisher can grow to a large value with a lot of constant as well as changing data fields and maintaining such huge and complex data as a mere nested or embedded schema object would be inefficient , thus we choose to link them by reference maintaining a one to many relationship.
